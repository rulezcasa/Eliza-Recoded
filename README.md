# ELIZA-Recoded

## Overview
ELIZA-Recoded is a regex-based chatbot designed for human-computer interaction. Originally developed at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s, ELIZA simulates conversation by recognizing predefined patterns and responding with rule-based outputs. This is a recoded version in python just for the sake of understanding and getting hands on with regex. 

I'm enhancing this with patterns and responses catering to my girlfriend's rant sessions ðŸ˜… !




## Example Interaction
```
User: My head hurts.
ELIZA: Why do you say your head hurts?

User: I feel sad.
ELIZA: I am sorry to hear that you feel sad. Tell me more about it.
```
